Microsoft .themepack wallpapers package installer for Q4OS with Trinity DE.  
  
It can be used in terminal with a full path themepack namefile in argument, or it can be installed as a servicemenu action for the .themepack extension with the argument "install"  
  
Once invoked with a themepack file or launched with the servicemenu if installed, it will decompress the themepack, and configure kdesktop to do a diaporama with the themepack images,
just like the behavior you have with these files on windows 10/11.

installation: just clone the repository, cd to it, make it executable: sudo chmod +x themeinst.sh
and use it from command line or install it with ' ./themeinst.sh install'
