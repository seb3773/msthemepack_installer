Microsoft .themepack / .deskthemepack wallpapers package installer for Q4OS with Trinity DE.  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
It can be used in terminal with a full path themepack namefile in argument, or it can be associated to the .themepack/.deskthemepack extensions with the argument "install"  
  
Once invoked with a themepack file from the terminal or launched by left clicking on a themepack if association is installed, it will decompress the themepack, and configure kdesktop to do a diaporama with the themepack images, just like the behavior you have with these files on windows 10/11.

- Installation: just clone the repository, cd to it, make it executable: sudo chmod +x themeinst.sh
and use it from command line or install it with ' ./themeinst.sh install'  

  
You can download lots of .themepack here for example: https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/th%C3%A8mes-du-bureau-94880287-6046-1d35-6d2f-35dee759701e#WindowsVersion=Windows_10

This script was created to be a part of Q4OStools scripts, but can be used independently of it. Just be sure you have 7z installed.
